Currently there is a binary build only for *Windows 32-bit*.
"Download binaries for Windows here":http://github.com/downloads/tempestad/Colori/Colori_v0.9_windows_32_bin.zip
You might need to install OpenAL first, the installer is in the zip file. Extract the zip file, install OpenAL and run colori.exe.

For *GNU/Linux* you can download the latest version using git, and then install:
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/tempestad/Colori.git colori
cd colori/build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
colori</code></pre>
Alternatively, you can download the latest tag from the "downloads page":http://github.com/tempestad/Colori/downloads
In order to build from source code you will need:
* "cmake":http://www.cmake.org/ v2.6 minimum
* "sfml-system":http://www.sfml-dev.org/ v1.6
* "sfml-window":http://www.sfml-dev.org/ v1.6
* "sfml-graphics":http://www.sfml-dev.org/ v1.6
* "sfml-audio":http://www.sfml-dev.org/ v1.6

SFML v1.5 seems to work too.
